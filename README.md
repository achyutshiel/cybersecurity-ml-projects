# Machine Learning Projects – Cybersecurity Domain

This repository contains two machine learning projects developed as part of an internship in the **Cybersecurity with Machine Learning** domain.  
Both projects demonstrate the practical application of AI/ML techniques to solve real-world cybersecurity problems.

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Task 1: ML-Based Credit Card Fraud Detection System
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.  
Financial fraud is a critical cybersecurity concern, and this system helps identify suspicious transactions by analyzing historical transaction patterns.

### 🔹 Task 2: ML-Based Spam & Phishing Detection System
This project implements a spam and phishing detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It classifies messages as **legitimate** or **spam/phishing**, helping mitigate risks related to email-based social engineering attacks.

## 📊 Task 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Problem Statement
Credit card fraud causes significant financial losses and security risks. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

### Solution
A **Random Forest Classifier** was trained to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.  
Class imbalance was handled using **SMOTE**, and the model was evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### Key Highlights
- Handles imbalanced transaction data  
- Achieved **accuracy greater than 90%**  
- Suitable for financial cybersecurity applications

## 📧 Task 2: Spam & Phishing Detection

### Problem Statement
Spam and phishing attacks are common vectors for credential theft and social engineering. Manual filtering is inefficient and error-prone.

### Solution
A **Naive Bayes classifier** combined with **TF-IDF vectorization** was used to analyze message content and classify it as spam/phishing or legitimate.

### Key Highlights
- NLP-based text classification  
- Achieved **~97% accuracy**  
- Tested using real-world cybersecurity content
